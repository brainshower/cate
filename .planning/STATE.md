# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-06-01 after v1.1 upstream sync planning)

**Core value:** Cate should let a developer use FlashQuery knowledge from inside the same spatial workspace where they already code, inspect files, run terminals, and collaborate with AI agents.
**Current focus:** Phase 8 upstream sync to Cate `v1.1.0` complete.

## Current Position

Phase: 8 — Upstream Sync to `v1.1.0`
Plan: 8.6 — Verification, runbook, provenance, and release readiness
Status: Complete
Last activity: 2026-06-01 — upstream `v1.1.0` merged and verified on `sync/upstream-v1.1.0`

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-01
Stopped At: Phase 8 verification complete
Resume File: None

## Next Up

Review/merge `sync/upstream-v1.1.0` when ready. Phase 8 verification lives at `.planning/phases/08-upstream-sync-v1-1-0/08-VERIFICATION.md`.

## Decisions

Full decision log lives in `.planning/PROJECT.md` "Key Decisions" table (updated after each phase transition and milestone). v1.0 phase-level decisions are also preserved verbatim in `.planning/milestones/v1.0-phases/*/SUMMARY.md` `key-decisions:` frontmatter. STATE.md begins fresh with the next active milestone.

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-06-01 | Phase 8 uses the upstream sync requirements/test plan as mandatory source-of-truth docs. | Keeps migration planning aligned to the product spec and ensures implementation agents do not answer scope questions from memory. |
| 2026-06-01 | Phase 8 is a migration phase, not a new FlashQuery feature phase. | Prevents scope creep while merging upstream `v1.1.0`. |
| 2026-06-01 | Upstream `v1.1.0` was merged as a real two-parent merge commit. | Preserves future sync provenance and advances the fork's upstream merge base to `5b6549d`. |

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close on 2026-05-30:

| Category | Item | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| uat_gap | phase-05-uat-tool-false-positive | acknowledged — Phase 5 UAT is status: passed with 5/5 tests, 0 pending scenarios, 0 issues, 0 gaps. The `gsd-sdk query audit-open` heuristic flagged the file but inspection shows it is fully complete. No remediation needed; flagging the tool behavior for future improvement. |
